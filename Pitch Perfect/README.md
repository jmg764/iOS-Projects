# Pitch Perfect

Pitch Perfect is an iOS app that allows users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app also lets the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.


# Implementation

1. **RecordViewController** consists of a record button with a microphone image. Tapping this button begins an audio recording session. When the stop button is tapped, the recording session is ended, and the PlaySoundsViewController is presented.
2. **PlaySoundsViewController** allows the user to replay the recorded audio using six different effects.
