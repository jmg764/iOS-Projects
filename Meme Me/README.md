# Meme Me

Meme Me allows the user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. Memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.


# Implementation 

Using the tab bar, the user can toggle between seeing their memes in either a table or collection view (**MemeTableViewController** and **MemeCollectionViewController**, respectively). Pressing the plus button on the upper right corner of either view launches **MemeEditorViewController**, which allows the user to upload an image and edit top and bottom text in creating their meme.
